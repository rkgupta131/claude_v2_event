# GitHub Push Command with Personal Access Token

## Step 1: Get Your Token
Visit: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
- Name: "API Push Token"
- Expiration: 90 days (or your preference)
- Scopes: Check "repo" (Full control of private repositories)
- Click "Generate token"
- COPY THE TOKEN (you'll only see it once!)

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

Run this command (replace YOUR_TOKEN with your actual token):

git push https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/rkgupta131/claude_v2_event.git main

Example:
git push https://ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@github.com/rkgupta131/claude_v2_event.git main

## Alternative: If you want me to push for you

Just provide your token and I'll execute the push command for you.
